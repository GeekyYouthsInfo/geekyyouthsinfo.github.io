# Favicon Placeholder

Since this is a text-based setup, you'll need to create actual favicon files. Here are the files you should create:

## Required Favicon Files:

1. **favicon.ico** (16x16, 32x32) - Place in /assets/
2. **apple-touch-icon.png** (180x180) - Place in /assets/images/
3. **icon-192x192.png** (192x192) - Place in /assets/images/
4. **icon-512x512.png** (512x512) - Place in /assets/images/

## Favicon HTML (already included in index.html):
```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="assets/favicon.ico">
```
